Based on the data that is organized under the Jupyter Notebook, there are some conclusions that can be drawn. The data used is a pretty large sample size with 15 schools observed and scores for 39k students. Looking at mean scores for both reading and math, students scored 81.9 points, on average, in the reading portion. They only scored 79.0 points in the math portion. So an observer can see that student's score higher in their reading portions than their math.

The data also points at some data that can be used to make improvements in these different schools. When looking at scores by school spending, the percentage of students passing math and/or reading actually decrease as the amount of money spent per student increases. For example, 3 of the 5 lowest performing schools fall into the last spending bin of $645-680 spent per student and have less than 70% of their students passing math. However these schools are having around 80% of students pass reading courses. The percentage of students passing both classes however is around 50% for all of these schools. What this may indicate to school administrators is that they may need to reallocate or find ways to redistribute the budget to help strengthen those math scores.

Looking at school size also shows an interesting trend. Similar to the trend found in the spending data. As the student population increases for a given school then the average scores and percentage of students passing also decreases. This can indicate to researchers or whoever is acting on this data, that student size is negatively affecting the student's ability to be successful. While the data is limited and can not point out what about student size is negatively affecting student success, it does provide a new avenue of research to help further improve academic achievement for these schools.
